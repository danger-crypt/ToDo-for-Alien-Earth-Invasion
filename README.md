# ToDo-for-Alien-Earth-Invasion
Project for freeCodeCamp's FullStack Web Dev curriculum, in the CSS portion. Chose to make a satire Alien Invasion of Earth ToDo List.

Currently working through the "FullStack Web Developer" curriculum provided by freeCodeCamp. I've completed the HTML portion of the course. I'm now within the CSS portion. The project was the "Build a Stylized To-Do List", and while it had parameters I was to follow, I found that it also left much open in the sense that I was free to have fun with this project. 

So I decided to make a satire To Do List. From the perspective of Aliens preparing to Invade Earth. I'm a novice in the field of programming, web development in particular. So while I utilized outside resources (other than solely what I've learned thus far on freeCodeCamp) to make this in the image I intended for it to be, I know it's nothing crazy. Anyway. Felt I should go ahead and share this to my Github, as I hope to one day be able to work doing programming or development, and I lack any formal education surpassing a G.E.D. Therefore, I hope to begin making my Github into a developer portfolio where at some point, maybe my work will speak for itself and help with possible work opportunities or frankly any opportunities! Enjoy!
